The French alphabet contains the 26 letters of the basic Latin alphabet. In addition there are five diacritics and two ligatures, which yields 16 additional characters (à, â, æ, ç, é, è, ê, ë, î, ï, ô, œ, ù, û, ü, ÿ). Sometimes ä and ö are also included, resulting in a total of 44 characters. However, in the context of pangrams, these accented letters and ligatures are usually not treated as separate letters.
